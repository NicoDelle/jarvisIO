This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

# AudioProvider
This library defines how the audio is gathered from the DAQ and used for inference

# HcData
This header file contains some data useful for testing

# Model_tflite
This folder contains the compiled model
